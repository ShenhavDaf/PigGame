        <h1>Pig Game - How to play</h1>
        <p><!--Explanation of the game-->
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": <br />
          <li>
            If the player rolls a 1, he scores nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls any other number, it is added to his turn total
            and the player's turn continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player chooses to "hold", he turns total is added to his final score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
          </li>
          <br>
           The first player to score 100 or more points - wins. 🏆
           
           <br><br>
           <b>For example,</b> the first player,
            Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and save
            the score of 5 points to his final score, but chooses to roll again.
            Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but
            chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn
            without scoring. The next player, Alex, rolls the sequence
            4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total
            of 22 points to her final score.
